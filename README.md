# geonetwork-dutch-skin-docker

The Geonetwork usergroup Netherlands maintains a series of plugins to facilitate adoption of GeoNetwork in the Dutch context.

- [Schema profiles](https://github.com/metadata101/iso19139.nl.geografie.2.0.0)
- [Dutch skin](https://github.com/pvgenuchten/geonetwork-dutch-skin)

This repository contains a build script to craft a Docker image of GeoNetwork preconfigured with those plugins. The resulting docker image is made available via https://hub.docker.com/r/geocat/geonetwork-nl
